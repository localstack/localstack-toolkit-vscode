## Requirements

* [samlocal](https://github.com/localstack/aws-sam-cli-local) command line wrapper around the [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli) for use with [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack).
* [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/) running in the background.

## Known Issues

* Limitations
  * The CodeLens for "Deploy Lambda function" always appears at the first line of each Python file
  * "Invoke Lambda function" currently only works in the region `us-east-1` and with an empty payload.
